# More Clouds

_The internet, now with more clouds._ This little p5 scene started as the background to Whisper and Hal's website, and our library site, Spines. Inspired by d0n.xyz's [More Plants](https://donhanson.art/project/more-plants) extension, More Clouds replaces the background of any page with little fluffy clouds floating by.
